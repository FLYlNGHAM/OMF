# Intro
COALITION creates public ArmA content up to 150 players at https://www.coalitiongroup.net

The Coalition Mission Framework (CMF) is a mission-maker facing framework built inline with the CMF Addon and POTATO Tool. You most likely won't use this unless you were directed here from our community.

You can find information on making missions using the CMF on the [Coalition Group wiki page](https://coalitiongroup.net/wiki/index.php/Mission_Making)
